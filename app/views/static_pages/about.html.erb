    <p> Observing or taking active part of an event is where everything
    start. In our everyday life there are millions of events that take 
    place. Some of them are unique. For instance a very tastefull 
    cheesecake you ate in a shop is an experience you would like to 
    share with others. Or being part of a succesful demostration is
    also an experience that you can share.

<h2> How it works </h2>
<h4 class="pUnderH">Probably you have already started wondering how this whole think works
  <strong>efficiently</strong>. In the following you will find a basic explanation.
</h4>
<br />
<p> EventDB is a fully centralized database. Still its operation has much to do with networks
and specifically social and data-centric networks. Although the nature of events and their
relation have much to do with social networks, it is not always the case. In social networks
most of the times you connect with people that you know in real life. However, in EventDB
you might want to connect with people that just had the same experience with you today.

EventDB has been deployed basically using Ruby and Ruby on Rails framework. However, many
other third party frameworks have been used extensively in order to increase our quality.
