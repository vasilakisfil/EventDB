<h1> Search for events of your interest </h1>
<p class="pUnderH"> Haven't you ever felt that Google's 10 years old search engine is becoming
    restrictive? Well, all of us know the story of how Google was created, 
    "creating" a huge step forward in search engines. But has it really evolved
    since then?
</p>


<p> Using EventDB's vast database you can search for any event
 in a given place or time of a specific category or using tags. This would have
 a tremendous effect on numerous applications. </p>

<dl>
  <dt> You can find the charming stranger sitting opposite of you  in the
    train.
  </dt>
    <dd> Yeah right..it happens to all of us. Both of you wanted to meet each other but
      for some reason it just didn't happen. Sign in EventDB, publish your story and 
      you never know, the same thing might do the stranger!
    </dd>
  <dt> You can find your missing dog.
  </dt>
    <dd> Using other's people coinsidence you can find your dog. When you see a stray dog
      just post its location and its physical characteristics. You might be helping
      someone else who is looking for its own dog (or cat, or air matress or...)
    </dd>
  <dt> You can follow a thief's path </dt>
    <dd> Haven't you ever notice suspicious moves of a stranger near a house/car etc or
      suspicious running in the metro? Well you should report it in EventDB, maybe these
      suspicious moves have to do with a robbery or a theft. In that way you could help
      other people or even the police!
</dl>

<h1> Redefine Coincidence </h1>
<p class="pUnderH"> Do you believe in coinsidence or fate?  Have you ever experienced a
collecion of unrelated events that turn out to be related ? Well, with EventDB
you can find out what really happened !
</p>
<br />
<div class="row">
  <div class="span4">
    <h3><a href="#"> <span class="number">1.</span> Observe an event </a></h3>
    <p> Observing or taking active part of an event is where everything
    start. In our everyday life there are millions of events that take 
    place. Some of them are unique. For instance a very tastefull 
    cheesecake you ate in a shop is an experience you would like to 
    share with others. Or being part of a succesful demostration is
    also an experience that you can share.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="span4">
    <h3><a href="#"> <span class="number">2.</span> Publish your experience </a></h3>
    <p> Sign in EventDB and publish your experience. You can describe your involvement
    and your exposure to the event. You can also describe your feelings or your
    expectations no matter what the event is about! Upload your description and 
    optionally add photos or links!*</p>
  </div>
  <div class="span4">
    <h3><a href="#"> <span class="number">3.</span> Connect with other participants</a></h3>
    <p> Didn't you always want to learn who where "these" people that were
    with you that moment? Didn't you want to congratulate or express your pleasure about
    someone's action? EventDB facilitates you to learn and connect with new people that
    lived the same experience with you!</p>
  </div>
</div>


<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<h1> Connect with other people </h1>
<p class="pUnderH">You can connect and meet new people who have same experiences with you.
By broswing EventsDB's database and tags you can find stories that have in common with your
eperience. Thus, you can create new friends who have same experiences and interests with
you!

<h2> How it works </h2>
<p class="pUnderH">Probably you have already started wondering how this whole think works
<strong>efficiently</strong>. In the following you will find a basic explanation.
</p>
<p> EventDB is a fully centralized database. Still its operation has much to do with networks
and specifically social and data-centric networks. Although the nature of events and their
relation have much to do with social networks, it is not always the case. In social networks
most of the times you connect with people that you know in real life. However, in EventDB
you might want to connect with people that just had the same experience with you today.

EventDB has been deployed basically using Ruby and Ruby on Rails framework. However, many
other third party frameworks have been used extensively in order to increase our quality.
